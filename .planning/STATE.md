## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Security track (Phases 1, 2, 4) and UI track (Phases 3, 5) are independent -- can interleave Phases 2 and 3
- Roadmap: Critical middleware auth bug must be fixed before any other work
- 01-01: Handle root '/' as exact match separately from prefix-matched public routes to avoid re-introducing startsWith('/') bug

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- ~~Middleware auth guard is effectively disabled (pathname.startsWith('/') is always true) -- Phase 1 blocker for production~~ RESOLVED in 01-01
- RLS effective policy state unknown until audit in Phase 4
